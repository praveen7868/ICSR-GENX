# ICSR-GENX 🚀  
**GenAI-Powered Drug Safety Intelligence and ICSR Automation**

ICSR-GENX is a simulation project that automates key pharmacovigilance workflows using GenAI and rule-based logic. Inspired by Accenture’s SynOps platform, it showcases how independent innovators can replicate enterprise-grade ICSR processing — including adverse event detection, SLA tracking, causality assessment, and narrative generation — using cost-free tools.

## 🔍 Project Scope

- ✅ Case validation and triage
- ✅ Serious adverse event detection
- ✅ SLA compliance tracking (7-day/15-day deadlines)
- ✅ Causality assessment (Naranjo scale)
- ✅ GenAI-powered narrative generation
- ✅ Audit trail logging for inspection readiness

## 🔄 ICSR Workflow Simulated

1. **Case Receipt** – Intake of ADR data from structured sources  
2. **Case Validation** – Check for minimum criteria (patient, reporter, drug, event)  
3. **Duplicate Check** – Simulated duplicate detection logic  
4. **Case Triage** – Classify as serious or non-serious  
5. **SLA Compliance** – Track regulatory timelines and flag overdue cases  
6. **Causality Assessment** – Score using Naranjo scale logic  
7. **Narrative Generation** – Auto-generate ICSR text using GenAI or templates  
8. **Audit Logging** – Record actions for inspection simulation  
9. **Final Output** – Summary report per case
