# ICSR-GENX:**GenAI-Powered Drug Safety Intelligence and ICSR Automation**

**ICSR-GENX** is a simulation project that automates key pharmacovigilance workflows using GenAI-style logic and rule-based Python modules. Inspired by Accenture’s SynOps platform, it showcases how independent innovators can replicate enterprise-grade ICSR processing — including adverse event detection, MedDRA coding, and narrative generation — using cost-free tools.

## 🎯 Project Scope

This project simulates key components of Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR) processing using rule-based logic and GenAI-style automation. The following modules have been implemented:

- ✅ **Case validation and triage**  
  Filters incoming ADR cases and flags serious ones based on predefined criteria.

- ✅ **Serious adverse event detection**  
  Identifies and isolates cases marked as serious for priority handling.

- ✅ **GenAI-based narrative generation**  
  Automatically generates human-like case summaries using structured data fields.

- ✅ **Final case summary report generation**  
  Compiles processed cases into a structured output file for review or downstream use.

## 🔄 ICSR Workflow Overview

### 🔹 Real-World ICSR Process (Simplified)

1. **Case Receipt** – Intake of ADR data from structured or unstructured sources  
2. **Case Validation** – Check for minimum criteria (patient, reporter, drug, event)  
3. **Case Triage** – Classify cases as serious or non-serious  
4. **MedDRA Coding** – Standardize event terms using MedDRA dictionary  
5. **Narrative Generation** – Draft case summaries for regulatory review  
6. **Final Output** – Export processed cases for downstream use or reporting

### 🔹 What ICSR-GENX Implements

| Step               | Module             | Description |
|--------------------|--------------------|-------------|
| Case Receipt        | `raw_data.csv`      | Structured CSV input containing ADR case data |
| Case Triage         | `ae_detector.py`    | Flags serious cases based on seriousness criteria |
| MedDRA Coding       | `meddra_coder.py`   | Maps event terms to MedDRA Preferred Term and SOC |
| Narrative Generation| `narrative_gen.py`  | Generates GenAI-style summaries from structured fields |
| Final Output        | `narrative_cases.csv` | Consolidated output with enriched case data |

## 📝 Example Narrative Output

Below is a sample GenAI-style narrative generated by the `narrative_gen.py` module from structured ICSR data:

> **Case ID**: ICSR001  
> **Drug Name**: Metformin  
> **Narrative**: A 65-year-old male patient from India reported hypoglycaemia following administration of Metformin.  
> The case was classified as serious and the outcome was recovered.

This output is part of the `narrative_cases.csv` file located in the `/outputs` folder.  
Each narrative is automatically constructed using patient demographics, drug-event relationships, seriousness classification, and outcome status.

## 📣 Why This Project?

Accenture’s SynOps platform reduced PV report timelines from 50+ days to under a minute using GenAI. ICSR-GENX shows how similar intelligence can be simulated independently — without paid APIs or cloud infrastructure.

This project is ideal for:
- Pharmacovigilance and Clinical data management role job seekers
- Recruiters evaluating GenAI readiness
- Academic publishing and portfolio building
